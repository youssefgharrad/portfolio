## About Me

Welcome to my Developer Portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate web developer with experience in creating dynamic and interactive websites using modern technologies such as **React**, **Node.js**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **HTML5**. My focus is to build scalable and user-friendly applications while following best practices in development.

This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and professional journey. Feel free to explore my work and get to know more about my career and what I love to build!

## Quick Setup

To get started with this portfolio locally:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Check your installation by running:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

2. In the project directory, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

## Deployment

This portfolio is deployed using **GitHub Actions**. GitHub Actions is an automated platform that allows continuous integration and deployment, making it easy to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

Once the code is pushed to the main branch, the deployment process is triggered automatically by the configured workflow in `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`.

You can view the live version of the portfolio at: [**Your Portfolio Link**] (replace this with your actual link).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: For backend (if any) or serving the app.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD and deployment automation.
- **npm**: For managing dependencies and running scripts.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
- **Sass**: For styling and building a scalable CSS architecture.
