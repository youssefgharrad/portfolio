## About Me

Welcome to my Developer Portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate web developer with experience in creating dynamic and interactive websites using modern technologies such as **React**, **Node.js**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and more. My focus is to build scalable and user-friendly applications while following best practices in development.

This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and professional journey. Feel free to explore my work and get to know more about my career and what I love to build!

## Deployment

This portfolio is deployed using **GitHub Actions**. GitHub Actions is an automated platform that allows continuous integration and deployment, making it easy to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
